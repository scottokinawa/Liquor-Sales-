Liquor Sales in Iowa 

I wanted to look through Iowa liquor data and figure out if I could predict where to set profitable stores. 

I will try and create a model that can make this prediction for us.

The predictions I have made could always be improved upon with more data, but I am solely using the data found from government sites, 
regarding demographic and population density data I was able to collect.
