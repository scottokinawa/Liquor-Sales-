Liquor Sales in Iowa 

I wanted to look through Iowa liquor data and figure out if I could predict where to set profitable stores. 

## How I went about this process: 

1) I cleaned the data, using lambda functions to get rid of issues
2) I visulized the data to see what I was working with 
3) I tried switching up different fields to see what could be the optimal fields to include
4) I created a model that would help predict where would be the best location to open a liquor store.

The predictions I have made could always be improved upon with more data, but I am solely using the data found from government sites, 
regarding demographic and population density data I was able to collect.
